# 100DaysofCoding-Day9-Challenge-SilentAuction

In this lesson dictionaries were introduced and it was elaborated on how simple they can be if you understand them well enough. You were tasked with creating a silent auction program that registers eat name and bid into a dictionary and chooses the highest bid at the end. The program in itself was not difficult but the hardest part was using the new dictionary term. Also because each bid had to be cleared before the next person put in their information (hence the term silent auction) I had to use the replit IDE instead of my usual pycharm. The result is a script that can only run on replit. The goal will be to return to this script and find a way to create a clear function in pycharm and call it the same way i called the replit function.
